# Gameplay 
First Person Shooter Demo Game. When you spawn at market, you do not have a gun. A few step later you can find a coin that is glowing. You can pick the coin with required keybinding 'E'. After you have taken the coin you can see at your inventory left bottom on the screen. Later on, you can buy a weapon from a Sharkman with that coin. Now you have a gun, so you can hit the wooden crate and when you hit, you can see it will be shattered.
